# Correlation Analysis in Multi-Modal Data
A python implementation of the Techniques presented in '[1]' for model selection and correlation structure estimation in multiple datasets.
Given a multi-modal dataset, this technique estimates the following:
* The number of correlated components across the datasets.
* The structure of the correlated components

The technique solves the complete model selection problem shown above by employing bootstrap based hypothesis testing.
